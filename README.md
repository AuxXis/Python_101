## **These are my first steps coding in Phyton**

**Hi everyone!** 

Follow these first steps into coding, unfortunately the first exercises are all in spanish, I hope this is not a problem.
After a while I've been programing in English so it is just Unit one and two the ones in Spanish.

The topics are organized through units and inside the Units you can find **_boletines_** (report books) with various exercises inside them.

Find hereinafter every section directly linked with the code:

1. [**_UNIT_1_**](https://github.com/AuxXis/Python_101/tree/master/Tema_1)
  * [boletin_1](https://github.com/AuxXis/Python_101/tree/master/Tema_1/boletin_1)
    (_logical expressions_)
  * [boletin_2](https://github.com/AuxXis/Python_101/tree/master/Tema_1/boletin_2)
  * [boletin_3](https://github.com/AuxXis/Python_101/tree/master/Tema_1/boletin_3)
  * [boletin_4](https://github.com/AuxXis/Python_101/tree/master/Tema_1/boletin_4)
  * [boletin_6](https://github.com/AuxXis/Python_101/tree/master/Tema_1/boletin_6)
    (_Exercises full in English_)
        
  
  2. [**_UNIT_2_**](https://github.com/AuxXis/Python_101/tree/master/Tema_102)
     * [boletin_1](https://github.com/AuxXis/Python_101/tree/master/Tema_102/boletin_01)
      (_modular programming I_)
      
          *[boletin_1, exercise 7](https://github.com/AuxXis/Python_101/blob/master/Tema_102/boletin_01/ejercicio_7.py)
           (_Showing whether two dominos pieces fit without using tuples_)
      
      
For now on, I'll keep this repository updated and I'll try to keep them translated into English!
